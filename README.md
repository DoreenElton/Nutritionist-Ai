In creating our "Nutritionist AI" project, we wanted to make something user-friendly, so we went with the Streamlit framework. We also brought in the OpenAI GPT-3.5 Turbo model to give our chatbot a real human touch.
We aimed to build a friendly virtual nutritionist that helps people with nutrition, diet, and fitness questions. When users interact with our chatbot, they chat like they would with friends, asking questions and getting helpful responses. 
To improve the responses, we included information from api-ninjas.com about nutrition. Our project has a layout with a title and a place for users to type in their questions.
If you want to try it yourself, you must install a few things. Firstly, install the required libraries: streamlit, openai, and requests. 
Then save the code in a Python file, e.g., app.py, open a terminal, and navigate to the directory containing the file. You can just run the command streamlit run app.py, or however, you saved the python file. Streamlit will provide a localhost URL; open a web browser and visit the specified localhost URL.  
Throughout the whole process, we made sure to keep things secure with API keys, stick to usage limits, and think about the safety of user inputs and external data. 
This project showcases how developers can leverage powerful pre-trained models in practical applications without training a deep learning model from scratch.
